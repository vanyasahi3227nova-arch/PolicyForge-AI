# PolicyForge AI

AI-Powered Cybersecurity Policy Calculator for SMEs

PolicyForge AI is an intelligent cybersecurity governance platform designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) assess their cybersecurity posture and automatically generate customized, standards-aligned cybersecurity policies, procedures, and risk mitigation documentation.

This project bridges the gap between complex cybersecurity frameworks and real-world implementation by transforming organizational inputs into actionable cybersecurity governance artifacts.

Overview

Most SMEs lack the internal expertise, time, and budget required to develop formal cybersecurity policies aligned with recognized frameworks such as NIST or ISO 27001. PolicyForge AI solves this problem by acting as an AI-powered cybersecurity governance assistant.

The system collects structured organizational information, computes risk exposure, and generates professional cybersecurity policies tailored specifically to the organization's risk profile, operational scale, and technical environment.

PolicyForge AI enables organizations to transition from informal security practices to structured cyber governance.
